        <h2>Message from Secretary</h2>
        <p>Sports and Physical Education are essential components of human resource development, helping to promote good health, comradeship and a spirit of friendly competition, which, in turn, has positive impact on the overall development of personality of the youth. The Department of Sports, since its inception, has been pursuing the twin objectives of “Broadbasing of Sports” and “Achieving Excellence in Sports at the National and International levels” through the National Sports Policy, 2001.
        I am happy to have been given the opportunity to lead the Department at a time when our athletes have scripted history at the Olympics and Paralympics 2020, which is also an indication of the country’s progression towards becoming a top sporting nation. The Department is energized with these laurels, and will strive hard to bring further glory to the nation in the forthcoming international events, especially in the Olympics at Paris in 2024. Government of India, in association with the Indian Olympic Association and the National Sports Federations, is focusing specific attention on these mega international sporting events.
        In order to achieve global heights in sports, Government of India is committed to providing the best of training facilities to all the elite athletics and no effort is to be spared for their success.
        In other significant initiatives, Khelo-India, the flagship scheme of this Department is giving boost to the efforts of the Government of India for overall promotion and development of sports in the country. Over time, Khelo-India has diversified, and now, budding talent is being scouted from each district of the country. This Department is taking continuous strides to bring best of technological advances in the field of Bio-mechanics, Sports Sciences, Sports Psychology and Recovery to help our athletes and sports persons to achieve the global best standards in their performance. This Department shall continue to make efforts to provide the best supporting infrastructure facilities, equipment and other support mechanism to achieve excellence in sports.</p>
